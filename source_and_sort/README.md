# Source and Sort


## To Use

I initially started with the code from the React framework (found at https://github.com/reactjs/react-tutorial). The server.php file as well as the comments.json and app.json files are all from that framework. 

### Server
To start the web application, I used MAMP.
However, you can also start by typing the code below into Terminal. There will be some random echo output that I am looking to fix.

```php
php server.php 
```
After this, type http://localhost:3000/index.php into your browser to start the web application. 

##Goals
Have a clear button appear on top that will remove all highlighting.
Add line numbers to the source code.
Have a separate box appear to the right that lists the line numbers for each tag when the button corresponding to the tag is clicked.
Have each line number be a button that will redirect the user to that line in the source code.
Create an instructions page.

More goals (All UX additions to source code):
Add indentation to the source code. 
Add Sublime colors to the source code.
