# Source and Sort


## To Use

I initially started with the code from the React framework (found at https://github.com/reactjs/react-tutorial). The server.php file as well as the comments.json and app.json files are all from that framework. 

### Server
To start the web application, I used MAMP.
However, you can also start by typing the code below into Terminal. There will be some random echo output that I am looking to fix.

```php
php server.php 
```
